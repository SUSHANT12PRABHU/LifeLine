# `LifeLine`

## Introduction :

Disaster management is a complex process involving international, national and local organisations each with a distinct role to play. To respond to disaster situations a coordinated effort is required. Earthquakes, cyclones, droughts, floods etc are some of the natural disasters resulting into huge loss of lives and properties. The direct or indirect impacts of disasters, either natural or man-made are colossal damage, destruction and death. Lack or shortage of Medical facilities is a major cause of increase in the number of dead. This application is exclusively meant for Medical care centers and Hospitals for faster and better working during the disasters.
        
## Objective :

This app aims to perform 3 major functionalities:
1. **Rescue-Mail** : This feature of the app will receive the location of the accident or the disaster which will be sent by a victim or a disaster management organization, with the location and preferably a picture of the sight of the disaster.
2. **Rescue-Squad** : This feature of the app will be externally connected to the database of the Hospital. A message will be sent to the doctors. A code-red message will be sent to a group of doctors (generally available interns and higher year residents) who will have to report to the site. Another message will be sent to the surgeons so that they can make arrangements for the surgery. 
3. **Blood-Bank** : Even civilians would like to help during a disaster, but in most of the cases they are prohibited to enter the site. This app provides one of the possible ways of civilians to provide help. During a disaster, it is most likely that a hospital runs out of blood in its blood bank. This feature of the app allows us to send message to the people of specific blood group. This feature needs to be connected to a database containing a relation of pre-classified people on the basis of their blood group. This feature keeps track of number of bottles left and sends messages to the people of that particular blood group and notify the hospital about it.
